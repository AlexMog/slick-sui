  - Skins will render everything, including text, borders and even opaque backgrounds. 
  - There will be support for custom bounds checking (allowing you to have oddly shaped components). 
  - Components will no longer carry individual UI delegates. A skin is [i]global[/i] in the sense that all components use the same skin. (like the way themes work) This will make switching skins faster and also allow for better extendability w/ custom components. 
  - SuiDisplay will support state changes. You can use one SuiDisplay to retain the same GUI throughout multiple states (such as a menu) or you can use multiple displays. 
  - Point and Dimension classes will be added for convenience. 
  - An abstract SuiComponent class will be introduced. This will be the new base class for all widgets. 
  - A simple XML processing package will be added. This allows you to externalize your GUI. 
  - Borders will be removed as they will be rendered by Skins. 
  - Animations (such as scaling on a button hover) will be optionally supported.
